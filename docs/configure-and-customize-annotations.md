# Configuration & Customization of `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations`

## Install and Enable Annotations

1. Install the following Nuget package into your ASP.NET Core application.

    ```
    Package Manager : Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations
    CLI : dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations
    ```

2. In the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs`, enable annotations within in the Swagger config block:

    ```csharp
    services.AddSwaggerGen(options =>
    {
        //...
        options.EnableAnnotations();
    });
    ```

## Enrich Operation Metadata

Once annotations have been enabled, you can enrich the generated Operation metadata by decorating actions with a `SwaggerOperationAttribute`.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
[SwaggerOperation(
    Summary = "Creates a new product",
    Description = "Requires admin privileges",
    OperationId = "CreateProduct",
    Tags = new[] { "Purchase", "Products" }
)]
public IActionResult Create([FromBody]Product product)
```

## Enrich Response Metadata

ASP.NET Core provides the `ProducesResponseTypeAttribute` for listing the different responses that can be returned by an action. These attributes can be combined with XML comments, as described [here](configure-and-customize-swaggergen.md#include-descriptions-from-xml-comments), to include human friendly descriptions with each response in the generated Swagger. If you'd prefer to do all of this with a single attribute, and avoid the use of XML comments, you can use `SwaggerResponseAttribute`s instead:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
[SwaggerResponse(201, "The product was created", typeof(Product))]
[SwaggerResponse(400, "The product data is invalid")]
public IActionResult Create([FromBody]Product product)
```

## Enrich Parameter Metadata

You can annotate "path", "query" or "header" bound parameters or properties (i.e. decorated with `[FromRoute]`, `[FromQuery]` or `[FromHeader]`) with a `SwaggerParameterAttribute` to enrich the corresponding `Parameter` metadata that's generated by Swashbuckle:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult GetProducts(
    [FromQuery, SwaggerParameter("Search keywords", Required = true)]string keywords)
```

## Enrich RequestBody Metadata

You can annotate "body" bound parameters or properties (i.e. decorated with `[FromBody]`) with a `SwaggerRequestBodyAttribute` to enrich the corresponding `RequestBody` metadata that's generated by Swashbuckle:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult CreateProduct(
    [FromBody, SwaggerRequestBody("The product payload", Required = true)]Product product)
```

## Enrich Schema Metadata

You can annotate classes or properties with a `SwaggerSchemaAttribute` to enrich the corresponding `Schema` metadata that's generated by Swashbuckle:

```csharp
[SwaggerSchema(Required = new[] { "Description" })]
public class Product
{
    [SwaggerSchema("The product identifier", ReadOnly = true)]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [SwaggerSchema("The product description")]
    public string Description { get; set; }

    [SwaggerSchema("The date it was created", Format = "date")]
    public DateTime DateCreated { get; set; }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> In Swagger / OpenAPI, serialized objects AND contained properties are represented as `Schema` instances, hence why this annotation can be applied to both classes and properties. Also worth noting, "required" properties are specified as an array of property names on the top-level schema as opposed to a flag on each individual property.

## Apply Schema Filters to Specific Types

The `SwaggerGen` package provides several extension points, including Schema Filters (described [here](configure-and-customize-swaggergen.md#extend-generator-with-operation-schema--document-filter)) for customizing **all** generated Schemas. However, there may be cases where it's preferable to apply a filter to a specific Schema. For example, if you'd like to include an example for a specific type in your API. This can be done by decorating the type with a `SwaggerSchemaFilterAttribute`:

📝 `Product.cs`
```csharp
[SwaggerSchemaFilter(typeof(ProductSchemaFilter))]
public class Product
{
    //...
}
```

📝 `ProductSchemaFilter.cs`
```csharp
public class ProductSchemaFilter : ISchemaFilter
{
    public void Apply(IOpenApiSchema schema, SchemaFilterContext context)
    {
        schema.Example = new OpenApiObject
        {
            [ "Id" ] = new OpenApiInteger(1),
            [ "Description" ] = new OpenApiString("An awesome product")
        };
    }
}
```

## Add Tag Metadata

By default, the Swagger generator will tag all operations with the controller name. This tag is then used to drive the operation groupings in the swagger-ui. If you'd like to provide a description for each of these groups, you can do so by adding metadata for each controller name tag via the `SwaggerTagAttribute`:

```csharp
[SwaggerTag("Create, read, update and delete Products")]
public class ProductsController
{
    //...
}
```

> [!NOTE] 
> This will add the above description specifically to the tag named "Products". Therefore, you should avoid using this attribute if you're tagging Operations with something other than controller name - e.g. if you're customizing the tagging behavior with `TagActionsBy`.

## List Known Subtypes for Inheritance and Polymorphism

If you want to use Swashbuckle's [inheritance and/or polymorphism behavior](configure-and-customize-swaggergen.md#inheritance-and-polymorphism), you can use annotations to _explicitly_ indicate the "known" subtypes for a given base type. This will override the default selector function, which selects _all_ subtypes in the same assembly as the base type, and therefore needs to be explicitly enabled when you enable Annotations:

📝 `Startup.cs`
```csharp
services.AddSwaggerGen(options =>
{
    options.EnableAnnotations(enableAnnotationsForInheritance: true, enableAnnotationsForPolymorphism: true);
});
```

📝 `Shape.cs`
```csharp
// .NET 7 or later
[JsonDerivedType(typeof(Rectangle))]
[JsonDerivedType(typeof(Circle))]
public abstract class Shape
{
}

// .NET 6 or earlier
[SwaggerSubType(typeof(Rectangle))]
[SwaggerSubType(typeof(Circle))]
public abstract class Shape
{
}
```

## Enrich Polymorphic Base Classes with Discriminator Metadata

If you're using annotations to _explicitly_ indicate the "known" subtypes for a polymorphic base type, you can combine the `JsonPolymorphicAttribute` with the `JsonDerivedTypeAttribute` to provide additional metadata about the "discriminator" property, which will then be incorporated into the generated schema definition:

📝 `Startup.cs`
```csharp
services.AddSwaggerGen(options =>
{
    options.EnableAnnotations(enableAnnotationsForInheritance: true, enableAnnotationsForPolymorphism: true);
});
```

📝 `Shape.cs`
```csharp
// .NET 7 or later
[JsonPolymorphic(TypeDiscriminatorPropertyName = "shapeType")]
[JsonDerivedType(typeof(Rectangle), "rectangle")]
[JsonDerivedType(typeof(Circle), "circle")]
public abstract class Shape
{
    // Avoid using a JsonPolymorphicAttribute.TypeDiscriminatorPropertyName
    // that conflicts with a property in your type hierarchy.
    // Related issue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/72170
}

// .NET 6 or earlier
[SwaggerDiscriminator("shapeType")]
[SwaggerSubType(typeof(Rectangle), DiscriminatorValue = "rectangle")]
[SwaggerSubType(typeof(Circle), DiscriminatorValue = "circle")]
public abstract class Shape
{
    public ShapeType ShapeType { get; set; }
}

[JsonConverter(typeof(JsonStringEnumConverter))]
public enum ShapeType
{
    Circle,
    Rectangle
}
```

This indicates that the corresponding payload will have a "shapeType" property to discriminate between subtypes, and that property will have a value of "rectangle" if the payload represents a `Rectangle` type and a value of "circle" if it represents a `Circle` type. This detail will be described in the generated schema definition as follows:

```yaml
schema: {
  oneOf: [
    {
      $ref: "#/components/schemas/Rectangle"
    },
    {
      $ref: "#/components/schemas/Circle"
    },
  ],
  discriminator: {
    propertyName: shapeType,
    mapping: {
      rectangle: "#/components/schemas/Rectangle",
      circle: "#/components/schemas/Circle",
    }
  }
}
```
